# Trees used in Steinworth et al. 2022
The trees shown here were generated using the main subalignment, subalign2 (https://github.com/josephryan/Steinworth_CnidarianHox/blob/master/01-ALIGNMENTS/subalign2)
### RAxML_bestTree.raxML_rt
This tree was generated by running RAxML with 25 random starting trees.
### RAxML_bipartitions.T15
This tree is Figure 1 in the paper, before the genes were renamed and duplicates pruned. It was generated by running RAxML with 25 maximum parsimony starting trees, then running rapid bootstrapping. We selected it for the main figure because the likelihood score was better than the scores for the Bayesian trees, IQ-TREE, or the RAxML tree generated with random starting trees.
### RAxML_renamed.tre
This tree is RAxML_bipartitions.T15 with duplicate sequences removed and genes given names.
### hox.nex.con1.tre and hox.nex.con2.tre
These two Bayesian trees are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. They were generated with two independent runs of MrBayes. Because the runs did not converge after 10,000,000 generations, we generated a strict consensus tree for each run.
### iqtree.treefile
This tree was generated by running IQ-TREE.
