# Trees used in Steinworth et al. 2022
Unless otherwise specified, the trees shown here were generated using the main subalignment, subalign2 (https://github.com/josephryan/Steinworth_CnidarianHox/blob/master/01-ALIGNMENTS/subalign2)
### RAxML_bipartitions.T15
This tree is Figure 1 in the paper. It was generated by running RAxML with 25 maximum parsimony starting trees, then running rapid bootstrapping. We selected it for the main figure because the likelihood score was better than the scores for the Bayesian trees, IQ-TREE, or the RAxML tree generated with random starting trees.
### RAxML_bestTree.raxML_rt
This tree was generated by running RAxML with 25 random starting trees.
### iqtree.treefile
This tree was generated by running IQ-TREE.
### hox.nex.con1.tre
### hox.nex.con2.tre
These two Bayesian trees are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. They were generated with two independent runs of MrBayes. Because the runs did not converge after 10,000,000 generations, we generated a strict consensus tree for each run.
