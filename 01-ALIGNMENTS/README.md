# Homeobox alignments used in Steinworth et al. 2022

### all_hox_plus.fa
Homeobox sequences from cnidarian transcriptomes plus previously published bilaterian and cnidarian Hox and Hox-related sequences

### all_hox_plus.fa_wholeSeqs
cnid_hox_plus.fa after sequences with five or more gaps have been removed

### fig1_alignment
Sequences in this alignment have the gene names we gave them in the paper, rather than the ID numbers in the transcriptome. This alignment was created from subalign2 by changing gene names and removing duplicates.

### subalign
all_hox_plus.fa_wholeSeqs after pruning sequences outside the clade defined by N. vectensis, with cloned C. xamachana sequences that had been removed for gaps added

### subalign2
subalign after an additional pruning step, again removing sequences outside the N. vectensis-defined clade; some sequence names have also been shortened
